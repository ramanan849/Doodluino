This repo contains the entire version history of my project code, right version 1, till verion 7.0, the final one. Some of the earlier ones might not be as refined as the latter ones, in terms of both documentation and stability. But, all of them use the same pins for the TFT display, but some versions might have different pins for the joystick. Also, the earlier versions (<= version 4 and or 5) might not have the speaker, LM386 amplifier and musical notes code in them.
